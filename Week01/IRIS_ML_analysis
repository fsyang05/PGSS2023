# Using only single variables to train the machine learning model, we can try to determine which one is the most influential / most important in determining the final classification.

Using 'petal.length' as the feature we train our model on:
  precision = .72
  recall = .72
  f1-score = .71
Using 'petal.width':
  precision = .55
  recall = .53
  f1-score = .54
Using 'sepal.length':
  precision = .95
  recall = .95
  f1-score = .95
Using 'sepal.width':
  precision = .94
  recall = .94
  f1-score = .94

Based on the results, it is clear that sepal length and width are the most influential factors in classifying the type of iris.
We deduce this from the fact that when trained on those two single variables, the model retains a comparatively high accuracy.
